# The Genex Core Project

#### Who are we?
Well its a bit of a long story but I'll shorten it. Genex was originally a *Cryptonight* coin but was only in the early stages. The Core Developer was mining somebody else's coin based on Scrypt, that got quickly took over by ASIC's and the coin went offline. So, what happened then was *Genex* spoke with the creator of that coin, *Zer0coin (ZER0)* and they decided to team up to create an ASIC resistant coin. After many failed attempts we decided to take a step back. Go straight back the original Crypto, *Bitcoin (BTC)* and make a successful fork from that. We will slowly, as a team, make every step needed to make a successful fork of *Bitcoin* in to *Genex* that will be ASIC resistant and remain that way. We encourage people to *Fork* this repo and make Pull Requests *(PR's)*, by helping us create the crypto currency, you will earn a special spot in our Discord Server.
